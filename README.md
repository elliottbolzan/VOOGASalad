# VOOGASalad

A JavaFX team project (10-person group) for Duke's Computer Science 308 (Design and Implementation). For this final project, we built a game authoring engine and a game player (approximately 23,000 lines of code). 

This program is capable of creating, editing, and playing scrolling-platformer games. It can also create many other games, like FIFA, checkers, etc. 

Extra features are incorporated, like the ability to translate the user interface into all of the languages offered by Google translate at runtime. I developed this feature myself as a separate framework, called `polyglot`. It made use of Google's Cloud API.
