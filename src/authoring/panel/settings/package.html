<title>Settings Package</title>

<body>
<p>Contains the Settings class, in which the user can set game-wide settings. Only one class is currently provided: Settings.</p>
<p>Because Settings are unpredictable, an entire package is devoted to them. They could grow with time. As of now, any changes to Settings should take place in the Settings class.</p>
<p>Some examples of settings are: the game's name and the game's song.</p>
