<p>Contains one class, as of now: the EntityDisplay.</p>
<p>Classes in this package serve to visualize the user's default Entities. An entire package is provided, in the event that more classes will be necessary, at one point, to satisfy this objective.</p>
<p>As of now, all changes should be made in EntityDisplay, which extends EditableContainer to provide the ability to edit, remove, and create new Entities from a ListView.</p>
