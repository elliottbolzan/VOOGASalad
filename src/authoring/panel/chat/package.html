<body>
<p>Contains the implementation of a Chat system.</p>
<p>This Chat system is comprised of two parts: a GUI component called Chat, which lets the user set a username, see received messages and send new ones; and a Message class, which encapsulates a sender and a content.</p>
<p>This system is dependent on a networking library: currently, our project makes use of our discussion library.</p>
