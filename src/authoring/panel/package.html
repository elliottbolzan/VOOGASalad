<body>
<p>Contains the Panel class and all of its subviews. This package's subpackages are: the achievements, the chat, the creation, the settings, and the display.</p>
<p>The Panel is the central class: it provides a wrapper for a panel structure that displays subpanels and views. Those views can be added using one-line in Panel. To use this package, you must primarily interact with the Panel class.</p>
<p>If you wish to provide an extensive modification, please make an appropriate subpackage, following the guidelines set by previous coders.</p>
