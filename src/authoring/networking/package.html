<p>Contains the classes that serve to integrate the networking utility (from another team) with our project. The main class in the package is Networking.</p>
<p>The Networking class is the primary one in the package: it includes the methods used to create a server, connect to one, and obtain the IP address of the current machine. In addition, the Packet abstract class is central: it represents any message that is sent over the network to another VOOGASalad machine.</p>
