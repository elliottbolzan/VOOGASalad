/**
 * @author Elliott Bolzan
 *
 *         This class represents a View in the program. Specific kinds of views
 *         can extend this class, like CollapsibleView. Every View must have a
 *         title.
 * 
 *         This code's purpose: providing a base GUI class for all views in the
 *         project.
 * 
 *         Why I think this code is well designed: this code is as minimal as it
 *         should be. A View, in our project, is characterized by the fact it
 *         has a title and by the fact it can have subcomponents. This class
 *         provides this capability without providing any extra bells and
 *         whistles.
