In-Class User Feedback
======================
Written by Elliott Bolzan (as adapted from Nikita Zemlevskiy's notes). These are the elements Nikita noted that apply to my parts of the project.

--------------------

- Tell the user what Entities, Actions, and Events are.
- Make it clearer where users can edit parameters for Entities, Actions, and Events.
- Attaching a song is broken: because of Polyglot?
- Make it more clear that the Actions are displayed for one specific Event.
- Use GIF files for animation.
- Show width and height instead of scale in Authoring Environment.
- Universal new button should be a plus sign.
- Test game button needs to be fixed.
- Releasing over the panel makes it so you are still in click mode.
